# PRIMM Lists Lesson 1: creation, indexing and length
# 
# PREDICT
# Predict what this program does. What would be the output on the console?
# 
# RUN
# Run the program. What part of the output did you predict correctly?
# What part of the output was unexpected and why? 
# 
# INVESTIGATE
# 1. What happens if you change the line 
# print fruits[1]
# to 
# print fruits[3]? (This is called indexing the list.)
# 
# 2. What happens if you change the square brackets [ ] into parentheses ( ) in the first line?
# 
# 3. What happens if you change the line
# print fruits[2..4]
# to
# print fruits[1..3]? (This is called slicing the list.)
# 
# 4. Annotate the code to show where the program calculates the number of elements in the fruits list.
# What is the name of the variable that holds this value?
# 
# 5. What happens if you change the line
# print fruits[n - 1]
# to
# print fruits[n]? Why do you think this happens?
# 
# MODIFY
# 1. Edit the program so that the list now contains six fruits, by inserting "peach" at the end of the list.
# 
# 2. Modify the third line of code so that it prints "pear" instead of "apple". 
# 
# 3. Insert a line of code that prints
# ArrayList[ blueberry, cherry, peach ]
# to the console.
# 
# MAKE
# Create a new program with a list called "tv" which contains the titles of between four and eight television programs. 
# Print the whole list to the console and then print the first element to the console.
# Create variable numTV and set it to the length of your list. Use it to print the last element in your list. 
# Print the whole list to the console, except for the first and last elements.
