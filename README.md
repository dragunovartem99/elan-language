# Elan
_(short for '**e**ducational **lan**guage' but is also an English word meaning 'flair', 'style' or 'panache')_

**Elan** is a brand new programming language and integrated IDE, running within a browser.

**Elan** is multi-paradigm â€” meaning that it supports the:

- procedural (PP)
- object-oriented (OOP)
- and functional (FP) programming paradigms

## Purpose

**Elan** is specifically designed for teaching programming in schools â€” with a focus on ages 11-18 (that's Years 7-13, or KS3-KS5 in the [National Curriculum ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§](https://www.gov.uk/national-curriculum#key-stages)).

It is a UK-based project, explicitly conceived to support both the needs and the constraints of Computer Science the British school-level education system, and uses English language with British spellings.

It is the first new programming language to be designed with this intent since BBC Basic in 1981.
