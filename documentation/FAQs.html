<h3>Why learn (or teach) a programming language that isn't used in industry?</h3>

<p>Elan is designed specifically for teaching and learning programming, at high-school (KS3 - KS5) 
    and in first year university/college. It is <i>not</i> designed for professional developers, nor will
    we let it evolve into a professional language, which has been the fate of many educational languages -
    usually to the detriment of their educational merits.
</p>

<p>There are very good arguments as to why the requirements for a good educational language
    are different to those for a good professional language. See, for example, 
    <a href="https://infedu.vu.lt/journal/INFEDU/article/797/info">Principles of Educational Programming Language Design</a> by Michael KÃ¶lling, 
    Informatics in Education Volume 23, Issue 4 (2024).</p>

    <p>Learning to program in a language used in industry isn't as useful as many people imagine:
        because there are <i>many</i> languages used in industry: so what are the chances that
        the one you have learned happens to be the one used in the organisation you want to join?</p>

    <p>More important than 'Is [the language I am going to learn] used in industry?' is
        the question, 'Will this language make it easier, for me to switch to another language in future?'
        and, even more important, 'Will this language help me to learn to program <i>well</i>?'.</p>


    <p>Elan is designed to lay a far better foundation than you are going to get from learning
        Python, VB, C#, Java, or any other language widely used in education today. It directly
        <i>prevents</i> you from learning bad habits that those languages can encourage. 
        To pick just one of many examples: why start off writing 'global' variables only to have to learn, later on, not to
                use them at all? Elan doesn't allow you to define any global variables.</p>

    <p>If you pursue programming beyond your current educational level, there's a high chance 
        that you'll have to learn to do 'functional programming' in a language such as Haskell.
        The hard part isn't learning the different syntax of Haskell; the hard part is learning how
        to build systems from pure, side-effect free functions. But if you had learned Elan first,
        the transition is going to be much easier, because in Elan you could never have learned
        to create side-effects or system dependencies in functions - because Elan prevents them.
        And while, for most professional programmers, it takes years to get into the habit of writing
        unit tests for all your functions, Elan encourages that from the very beginning of programming
        by making it an integral feature of the language and very simple to use.
    </p>

    <h3>Is Elan a compiled language</h3>
    <p>Yes - Elan source is compiled to JavaScript and runs very fast. As with most modern languages
        the compilation process is invisible to the user.</p>

    <h3>Can an Elan program be run without the Elan IDE</h3>

<p>Yes.When you've written and tested your Elan program, you can simply use <b>File > Save as standalone</b>
    to save the program (compiled to JavaScript) within a standalone .html page. You can email this
    file to anyone else. They can open it in their browser and it runs automatically - all they see
    is a larger version of the <b>Display</b> pane. They don't need to know anything about Elan.</p>

    <h3>Can I install Elan on my school server?</h3>

    <p>Yes. If you go to <b>Help > Version history</b> you can download a .zip file for the current
    or previous releases of Elan. This can unzipped into any web-server for private access.</p>

    <h3>Can we trust that Elan will <i>remain</i> free to use?</h3>
<p>Yes. We are committed to this on principle and we have a governance board to ensure that continues.
    It is also worth pointing out that Elan is just 'single page app' - once you have accessed
    the Elan IDE your code is edited, compiled, and run entirely within your browser, and Elan
    files are saved locally. This means that we have no expensive server infrastructure to maintain,
     or fund. Moreover, since Elan, its documentation, and associated teaching resources, are all open
      source, there is nothing to stop you, or anyone else from serving up this same page and resources.
      From your own server. We recommend that you use our version 
      (at <a href="https://elan-lang.org">https://elan-lang.org</a>) if you can only because that 
    way you will automatically be using the latest version.
</p>

<h3>Is Elan compatible with GCSE / A-level exams?</h3>

<p>As it stands, Elan is fully compatible with OCR GCSE and A-level Computer Science, because
    the OCR specifications explicitly state that you may answer programming questions in
    <i>any high-level language</i>. Moreover, because Elan syntax is <i>very close</i> to
    the OCR 'pseudo code' specification - at least for all the coding constructs expected by OCR 
    - answers given in Elan will be easily comprehensible to <i>any</i> OCR examiner.</p>
